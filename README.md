## SpaceFermi

A time paradox occurred ... the app is not ready yet  

## Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is required to install dependencies and run scripts via `npm`.

## How to run

1. First install the dependencies `npm i`  
2. Then run with `npm run start`  
3. Open <http://localhost:3000/> or wait for a second
4. All the changes to the main app logic are made through src/index.js file. Feel free to create separate .js files for additional logic and add them to index.js via `import`
