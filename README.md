## SpaceFermi

A time paradox occurred ... the app is not ready yet  

## How to run

1. First build with `npm run build`  
2. Then run with `npm run start`  
3. Open http://localhost:8080  
4. All the changes to the main app logic are made through src/index.js file. Feel free to create separate .js files for additional logic and add them to index.js via `import`
